I am a linux and open-source software enthusiast living in Cape Town,
South Africa.

I work for the [University of Cape Town](http://www.uct.ac.za) (UCT) as
a Systems Administrator in the [Department of Computer
Science](https://www.cs.uct.ac.za).  I primarily look after
infrastructure design and run a large-ish fleet of linux servers and
workstations.

Before that I worked for [Information and
Communication Technology Services](http://www.icts.uct.ac.za) (ICTS)
as a Network Infrastructure Technical Specialist doing network design
and managing unix servers and, predominantly, Cisco switches and routers.

I am a founding member of the 
[Western Cape Linux Users’ Group](http://www.clug.org.za) (CLUG) serving
as the Secretary for a number of years. I am also a co-founder and core
member of the UCT [Linux Enthusiasts’ Group](http://www.leg.uct.ac.za)
(LEG).

My professional interests are predominantly in the areas of unix -
especially linux, open-source software, programming - primarily in
python these days,  task automation and configuration management using
puppet.

In my spare time I hike, swim, garden, read and play around with 
electronics and wood work.
